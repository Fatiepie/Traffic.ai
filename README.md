# Traffic.ai
Welcome to traffic.ai, an artificial intelligence system that learns and identifies the different traffic signs available for road use, using TensorFlow, Keras API, and OpenCV! The AI who I have named Francesco gets fed in with a dataset (the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark or gtsrb dataset) to teach it the different types of traffic signs that are there. 

Francesco then uses the different libraries to create a convolutional neural network (or CNN for short) to train an ML model to correctly identify the said traffic signs. The CNN consists of 2 convolutions, 1 max pool, and a single hidden layer with a dropout rate of 50% to avoid overfitting.

Francesco would then train the CNN model for 10 EPOCHS or 10 reps to complete the task. I played around with the architecture and figured that it would best if I increased the number of nodes in the convolution and hidden layers to create a better model.
